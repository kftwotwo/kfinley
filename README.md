## Desiption

This is going to replace my old site in Heroku. This site will be used as an how-to repair guide for vehicles. This will use Edmunds api which I will attempt to create a ruby gem. It will be free for all. Subscribed users will be able to upload how-to's, comment, like, and posts. On the website you will be able to how-to's as pdfs. When the user is on a how-to guide recommend youtube videos will display. This website will not be liable to any damage to anyone's property. This website will have a blog section for updates.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Clone the repository and `cd` into your directory:
```
$ bundle install
```
